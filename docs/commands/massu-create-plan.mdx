# /massu-create-plan

The `/massu-create-plan` command creates a structured plan document for a proposed change. It analyzes the request, identifies affected files and components, defines deliverables, and produces a markdown plan file in `docs/plans/`.

## Usage

```
/massu-create-plan Implement user profile editing with avatar upload
```

## What It Produces

A plan document at `docs/plans/YYYY-MM-DD-feature-name.md` containing:

### Plan Structure

1. **Objective**: Clear statement of what will be built
2. **Scope**: Files that will be created, modified, or deleted
3. **Deliverables**: Numbered list of specific items to implement
4. **Verification Requirements**: How each deliverable will be verified
5. **Blast Radius**: Analysis of what existing code will be affected
6. **Dependencies**: External packages or internal modules needed
7. **Risk Assessment**: Potential issues and mitigations

### Example Plan Output

```markdown
# Plan: User Profile Editing

**Date**: 2026-02-13
**Status**: Draft

## Objective
Implement user profile editing with avatar upload for the settings page.

## Deliverables

| ID | Description | Files | Verification |
|----|-------------|-------|-------------|
| D-001 | Profile edit form component | src/components/settings/ProfileForm.tsx | VR-FILE, VR-GREP |
| D-002 | Avatar upload with crop | src/components/settings/AvatarUpload.tsx | VR-FILE |
| D-003 | Update profile API endpoint | src/server/routers/users.ts | VR-GREP |
| D-004 | Profile page integration | src/app/settings/profile/page.tsx | VR-FILE |
| D-005 | Input validation schemas | src/lib/validators/profile.ts | VR-FILE |

## Blast Radius
- src/server/routers/users.ts: Adding updateProfile mutation
- src/app/settings/layout.tsx: Adding profile link to sidebar

## Verification
- VR-FILE: File exists (ls -la)
- VR-GREP: Pattern exists in file (grep)
- VR-BUILD: npm run build exits 0
- VR-TEST: npm test passes
```

## Important Notes

- This command does NOT edit source code -- it only creates a plan document
- Plans should be reviewed (with `/massu-plan`) before implementation begins
- Plans are tracked by the memory system for cross-session continuity
- Reference the plan file in your prompts to enable automatic task linking
