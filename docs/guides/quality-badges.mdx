# Quality Badges

Display live quality, security, or cost score badges in your repository READMEs using shields.io-compatible SVG badges.

## Requirements

- **Plan**: Cloud Pro or higher

## Setup

1. Go to **Dashboard > Settings > Badges**
2. Configure your badge appearance and thresholds
3. Toggle "Public" to make the badge accessible
4. Copy the embed code

## Badge Types

| Type | Shows | Example |
|------|-------|---------|
| Quality | Average quality score | `quality: 85` |
| Security | Security posture score | `security: 92` |
| Cost | Cost efficiency score | `cost: 78` |

## Embedding

### Markdown

```markdown
![Quality](https://massu.ai/api/badge/your-org/quality)
```

### HTML

```html
<img src="https://massu.ai/api/badge/your-org/quality" alt="Quality Score" />
```

## Configuration

Customize badge appearance in the dashboard:

- **Label**: Text shown on the left side of the badge
- **Thresholds**: Score ranges for good (green), warning (yellow), and bad (red) colors
- **Colors**: Custom color names (brightgreen, green, yellow, orange, red)
- **Public**: Whether the badge is accessible without authentication

## Color Thresholds

| Score Range | Default Color | Meaning |
|-------------|--------------|---------|
| >= 80 | brightgreen | Good |
| >= 50 | yellow | Warning |
| < 50 | red | Bad |

Thresholds are fully configurable per badge type.

## Caching

Badge responses are cached for 5 minutes (`max-age=300`). Scores update as new sessions sync.
