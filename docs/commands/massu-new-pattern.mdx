# /massu-new-pattern

A pattern creation protocol that guides the process of defining, approving, and saving new development patterns. It ensures every new pattern includes WRONG/CORRECT examples, user approval, and is persisted to documentation before any code uses it.

## Usage

```
/massu-new-pattern
```

The command will prompt you to describe the functionality that needs a new pattern.

## Workflow Steps

### 1. Verify No Existing Pattern

Searches all pattern sources before creating anything new:
- `CLAUDE.md` for existing rules
- `.claude/patterns/` for domain-specific patterns
- `.claude/commands/` for related command documentation

If an existing pattern covers the use case, the command stops and points to it.

### 2. Define the New Pattern

Drafts a structured pattern definition including:
- **Pattern name and ID** (e.g., `TOOL-015`, `HOOK-005`)
- **Domain** (Tool, Config, Hook, Build, or Test)
- **Purpose and when to use**
- **WRONG example** with explanation of what breaks
- **CORRECT example** with explanation of why it works
- **Verification commands** to detect violations via grep

### 3. User Approval

Presents the full pattern definition for explicit user review. The pattern is not saved until the user approves. If modifications are requested, the pattern is updated and re-presented.

### 4. Save Pattern

After approval, the pattern is saved to the appropriate location:
- Domain-specific file in `.claude/patterns/` (e.g., `tool-patterns.md`, `hook-patterns.md`)
- Added to `CLAUDE.md` if marked as CRITICAL (violation blocks deployment)

### 5. Verification

Confirms the pattern exists in documentation with grep proof. Updates session state with the new pattern metadata.

## What It Does

- Searches all existing patterns to avoid duplication
- Enforces WRONG/CORRECT examples for every pattern
- Requires explicit user approval before persisting
- Saves patterns to the correct domain file
- Escalates critical patterns to CLAUDE.md
- Produces a pattern creation report with verification proof

## When to Use

- You need functionality with no existing pattern in CLAUDE.md
- Existing patterns do not fit a specific use case
- A recurring mistake needs to be codified as a rule with examples
- A new module or tool introduces conventions that should be documented
