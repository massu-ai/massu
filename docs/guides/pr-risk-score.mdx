# PR Risk Score

Automatically assess the risk of pull requests by combining impact, regression, security, and coupling analysis.

## Requirements

- **Plan**: Cloud Team or higher
- **API Key**: With `write` scope

## How It Works

PR Risk Score analyzes four dimensions of risk:

| Dimension | Weight | What It Measures |
|-----------|--------|-----------------|
| Impact | 30% | Blast radius of changes across the codebase |
| Regression | 25% | Likelihood of breaking existing functionality |
| Security | 25% | Security implications of the changes |
| Coupling | 20% | Cross-module dependencies affected |

## Risk Ratings

| Score | Rating | Meaning |
|-------|--------|---------|
| 0-30 | Low | Safe to merge with standard review |
| 31-60 | Medium | Requires careful review |
| 61-80 | High | Needs senior review and testing |
| 81-100 | Critical | Block merge until risks addressed |

## GitHub Actions Setup

Add this workflow to your repository:

1. Copy the workflow file from your Massu dashboard or download it from `https://massu.ai/massu-risk-score-action.yml`

2. Save it as `.github/workflows/massu-risk-score.yml`

3. Add your API key as a repository secret:
   - Go to **Settings > Secrets > Actions**
   - Add `MASSU_API_KEY` with your API key (must have `write` scope)

4. Pull requests will now automatically receive risk score comments.

## API Usage

Submit a PR for risk scoring directly via the API:

```bash
curl -X POST https://massu.ai/api/v1/risk \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer ms_live_XXXXXXXX_your_key" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "repo": "org/repo",
    "pr_number": 42,
    "pr_title": "Add user authentication",
    "files_changed": 15,
    "impact_data": { "score": 65 },
    "regression_data": { "score": 40 },
    "security_data": { "score": 80 },
    "coupling_data": { "score": 30 }
  }'
```
