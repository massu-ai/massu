# Workflow Commands

Massu AI provides 26 workflow commands organized into 7 categories that enforce a structured, verification-first approach to AI-assisted development. These are not suggestions -- they are mandatory execution protocols that ensure every plan is thorough, every implementation is verified, and every commit meets quality standards.

## Implementation Workflow

The core 5-command pipeline for structured development:

```
/massu-create-plan  -->  /massu-plan  -->  /massu-loop  -->  /massu-commit  -->  /massu-push
   (create)          (audit)      (implement)     (pre-commit)     (pre-push)
```

| Step | Command | Edits Source Code? | Purpose |
|------|---------|-------------------|---------|
| 1 | [/massu-create-plan](/docs/commands/massu-create-plan) | No | Create a plan document |
| 2 | [/massu-plan](/docs/commands/massu-plan) | No (plan doc only) | Audit and improve the plan |
| 3 | [/massu-loop](/docs/commands/massu-loop) | Yes | Implement with verification |
| 4 | [/massu-commit](/docs/commands/massu-commit) | Fixes only | Pre-commit verification gate |
| 5 | [/massu-push](/docs/commands/massu-push) | Fixes only | Pre-push full verification |

## Development Tools

4 commands for day-to-day development tasks:

| Command | Edits Source Code? | Purpose |
|---------|-------------------|---------|
| [/massu-test](/docs/commands/massu-test) | Yes | Intelligent test runner with failure analysis and generation |
| [/massu-debug](/docs/commands/massu-debug) | Yes | Systematic debugging with hypothesis testing |
| [/massu-refactor](/docs/commands/massu-refactor) | Yes | Safe refactoring with behavioral equivalence |
| [/massu-hotfix](/docs/commands/massu-hotfix) | Yes | Quick scoped fix with branch, test, commit, PR |

## Quality & Security

5 read-only analysis commands:

| Command | Edits Source Code? | Purpose |
|---------|-------------------|---------|
| [/massu-review](/docs/commands/massu-review) | No | Code review across 7 dimensions |
| [/massu-security-scan](/docs/commands/massu-security-scan) | No | Deep security audit (OWASP, RLS, secrets) |
| [/massu-audit-deps](/docs/commands/massu-audit-deps) | No | Dependency vulnerability and license audit |
| [/massu-website-check](/docs/commands/massu-website-check) | No | Website-specific verification (Next.js, Supabase) |
| [/massu-perf](/docs/commands/massu-perf) | No | Performance analysis (bundle, queries, edge functions) |

## Release & Ops

3 commands for release and operational tasks:

| Command | Edits Source Code? | Purpose |
|---------|-------------------|---------|
| [/massu-release](/docs/commands/massu-release) | Yes | Release preparation with full verification |
| [/massu-changelog](/docs/commands/massu-changelog) | CHANGELOG.md only | Generate changelog from commits |
| [/massu-migrate](/docs/commands/massu-migrate) | Yes | Database migration creation and validation |

## Diagnostics

2 read-only diagnostic commands:

| Command | Edits Source Code? | Purpose |
|---------|-------------------|---------|
| [/massu-status](/docs/commands/massu-status) | No | Project health dashboard with 14 checks |
| [/massu-feature-parity](/docs/commands/massu-feature-parity) | No | Enterprise feature comparison |

## Productivity

3 commands for codebase hygiene and documentation:

| Command | Edits Source Code? | Purpose |
|---------|-------------------|---------|
| [/massu-cleanup](/docs/commands/massu-cleanup) | Yes | Dead code removal, unused imports, orphaned files |
| [/massu-doc-gen](/docs/commands/massu-doc-gen) | Yes | Generate JSDoc, README, and API documentation |
| [/massu-onboard](/docs/commands/massu-onboard) | No | Generate onboarding guide for new team members |

## Insights

4 read-only analysis commands for retrospectives and planning:

| Command | Edits Source Code? | Purpose |
|---------|-------------------|---------|
| [/massu-retrospective](/docs/commands/massu-retrospective) | No | Session/sprint retrospective with actionable items |
| [/massu-accessibility](/docs/commands/massu-accessibility) | No | WCAG 2.1 accessibility audit |
| [/massu-estimate](/docs/commands/massu-estimate) | No | Effort estimation with complexity scoring |
| [/massu-benchmark](/docs/commands/massu-benchmark) | No | Performance benchmarking with baselines |

## Decision Tree

Not sure which command to use?

- **Starting new work** -- `/massu-create-plan` then `/massu-plan` then `/massu-loop`
- **Ready to commit** -- `/massu-commit`
- **Ready to push** -- `/massu-push`
- **Tests are failing** -- `/massu-test`
- **Bug to diagnose** -- `/massu-debug`
- **Urgent production fix** -- `/massu-hotfix`
- **Restructuring code** -- `/massu-refactor`
- **Before a code review** -- `/massu-review`
- **Security concerns** -- `/massu-security-scan`
- **Cutting a release** -- `/massu-release`
- **Schema changes** -- `/massu-migrate`
- **Project health check** -- `/massu-status`
- **Performance problems** -- `/massu-perf`
- **Dependency concerns** -- `/massu-audit-deps`
- **Deploying a website** -- `/massu-website-check`
- **Dead code / cleanup** -- `/massu-cleanup`
- **Generate documentation** -- `/massu-doc-gen`
- **Onboarding new member** -- `/massu-onboard`
- **Session retrospective** -- `/massu-retrospective`
- **Accessibility check** -- `/massu-accessibility`
- **Effort estimation** -- `/massu-estimate`
- **Benchmark performance** -- `/massu-benchmark`

## Why This Workflow?

AI assistants are powerful but they can also be careless. Without a structured workflow:

- Plans have gaps that only surface during implementation
- Implementations claim completion without verification
- Commits include untested or type-unsafe code
- Removals leave behind orphaned references
- "100% complete" turns out to be 80% complete

The Massu AI workflow prevents all of these problems by requiring proof at every stage.

## Core Principles

### 1. Plans Before Code

Every non-trivial change starts with a plan document. Plans live in `docs/plans/` and include specific deliverables, file paths, and verification requirements.

### 2. Verification Before Claims

Every claim of completion requires a verification command and its output as proof. "I verified it" without showing the command output is treated as unverified.

### 3. Negative Verification for Removals

When a plan says "remove X", verification requires `grep -rn "X" src/` returning 0 results. Partial removal is not removal.

### 4. All Items, Not Most Items

If a plan has 10 items, all 10 must be implemented and verified. Stopping at 8 and claiming complete is a protocol violation.

### 5. Protocols Are Mandatory

Slash commands are execution instructions, not suggestions. When a protocol says "loop until complete," it means loop until complete.
