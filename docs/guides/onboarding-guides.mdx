# Onboarding Guides

Automatically generate onboarding documentation for new team members from your team's collective AI session knowledge.

## Requirements

- **Plan**: Cloud Team or higher

## How It Works

The onboarding guide is built from your team's shared memory, observations, and session data. Massu analyzes this data to extract:

1. **Key Patterns** -- Common coding patterns your team uses, extracted from shared memory observations
2. **Common Mistakes** -- Frequent errors and anti-patterns with prevention strategies, sourced from failure observations
3. **Important Files** -- Critical files and entry points identified by frequency of access across sessions
4. **Domain Map** -- A guide to the codebase's logical domains and their boundaries
5. **Learning Path** -- A personalized progression from beginner to productive contributor

## Generating a Guide

### 1. Navigate to Onboarding

Go to **Dashboard > Team > Onboarding** to access the onboarding guide generator.

### 2. Generate or Regenerate

Click **Generate Guide** to create a new onboarding guide from current team data. Guides can be regenerated at any time to incorporate new knowledge.

### 3. Share with New Members

When a new member joins your organization, they automatically receive a welcome email with a link to the onboarding guide. You can also share the guide URL directly.

## Guide Sections

### Key Patterns

Extracted from team observations tagged as patterns or best practices. Includes code examples and explanations of why each pattern matters.

### Common Mistakes

Built from failure observations and incident learnings. Each entry includes:

- What went wrong
- Why it happened
- How to prevent it

### Important Files

Files ranked by how frequently they appear in team sessions. Helps new members understand which files are central to the project.

### Domain Map

A visual overview of the project's domain structure as defined in `massu.config.yaml`, enriched with session data showing which domains are most active.

### Learning Path

A suggested progression for new team members:

1. **Week 1** -- Setup, key files, and domain overview
2. **Week 2** -- Core patterns and common workflows
3. **Week 3** -- Advanced patterns and edge cases
4. **Week 4** -- Independent contribution with team conventions

## Keeping Guides Updated

Onboarding guides reflect your team's current knowledge. As your team accumulates more sessions and observations, regenerate the guide to keep it fresh.

## Welcome Emails

When enabled, new team members automatically receive a welcome email with:

- A personalized greeting
- A link to the onboarding guide
- A summary of what the guide contains
