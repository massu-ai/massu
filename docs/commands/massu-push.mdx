# /massu-push

The `/massu-push` command is the final quality gate before pushing to the remote repository. It runs a more comprehensive verification suite than `/massu-commit`, including full build verification, all tests, and pattern compliance.

## Usage

```
/massu-push
```

## Verification Suite

The command runs all `/massu-commit` checks plus:

### 1. Full Build

```
$ npm run build
```

Complete production build including hook compilation.

### 2. Hook Compilation

```
$ cd packages/core && npm run build:hooks
```

All hooks must compile with esbuild without errors.

### 3. Comprehensive Type Check

```
$ cd packages/core && npx tsc --noEmit
```

Full type checking across the entire project.

### 4. Full Test Suite

```
$ npm test
```

All tests must pass (not just affected tests).

### 5. Pattern Scanner

```
$ bash scripts/massu-pattern-scanner.sh
```

Complete pattern compliance check.

### 6. Security Scan

Reviews all changes being pushed for security vulnerabilities using the security scorer.

## Failure Handling

If any check fails:

1. The push is blocked
2. The specific failure is reported with details
3. Fixes are applied where possible
4. Checks are re-run
5. Push only proceeds when everything passes

## Important Notes

- This is the most thorough verification gate -- it catches issues that `/massu-commit` might miss
- Running `/massu-push` on a clean commit should always pass if `/massu-commit` passed
- The command does not force-push -- it uses standard `git push`
- May edit source files only to fix issues, never to add features
