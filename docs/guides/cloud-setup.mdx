# Cloud Setup Guide

This guide walks you through setting up Massu AI Cloud — the optional cloud layer that adds sync, dashboards, and team features on top of the open-source core.

## Prerequisites

- Massu AI core installed and running locally
- A Massu AI Cloud subscription (Cloud Pro or Cloud Team)
- Node.js 18 or later

## Step 1: Create Your Cloud Account

1. Visit [massu.ai/pricing](/pricing) and choose Cloud Pro or Cloud Team
2. Complete the checkout process
3. You'll receive a welcome email with your dashboard URL

## Step 2: Generate an API Key

1. Log in to your Cloud dashboard
2. Navigate to **Settings → API Keys**
3. Click **Generate New Key**
4. Copy the key — you'll need it in the next step

> **Security note:** Your API key should be stored securely and never committed to version control.

## Step 3: Configure Local Sync

Add your API key to your environment:

```bash
export MASSU_CLOUD_API_KEY=your-api-key-here
```

Or add it to your `massu.config.yaml`:

```yaml
cloud:
  enabled: true
  apiKey: ${MASSU_CLOUD_API_KEY}
  syncInterval: 300 # seconds
```

## Step 4: Verify the Connection

Run a sync check:

```bash
claude /massu-loop
# Look for: "Cloud sync: connected"
```

## What Gets Synced

| Data Type | Synced? | Notes |
|-----------|---------|-------|
| Quality scores | Yes | Aggregated per session |
| Observations | Yes | Memory entries |
| Audit trail | Yes | Compliance-ready |
| Session summaries | Yes | For dashboard analytics |
| Source code | **Never** | Code stays local |
| Credentials | **Never** | Keys stay local |

## Step 5: Explore the Dashboard

Your Cloud dashboard provides:

- **Session history** — Browse past coding sessions with quality metrics
- **Quality trends** — Track improvement over time
- **Cost tracking** — Monitor AI API costs per feature
- **Team activity** (Cloud Team) — See what your team is working on

## Troubleshooting

### "Cloud sync failed: unauthorized"

Your API key may be expired or invalid. Generate a new one from the dashboard.

### "Cloud sync failed: network error"

Check your internet connection. Cloud sync requires HTTPS access to `api.massu.ai`.

### Data not appearing in dashboard

Sync happens at configurable intervals (default: 5 minutes). Wait for the next sync cycle or trigger a manual sync.
