# /massu-hotfix

A streamlined workflow for small, urgent fixes that automates branch creation, testing, committing, and pull request creation with built-in scope guards to prevent hotfix scope creep.

## Usage

```
/massu-hotfix
```

The command will prompt for a brief description of the fix to create an appropriate branch name.

## Scope Guard

Hotfixes are strictly limited to **maximum 3 files**. If the fix requires modifying more than 3 files, the command will abort and recommend using `/massu-create-plan` instead for proper planning and implementation.

## Workflow Steps

### 1. Create Hotfix Branch
Creates a new branch with format `hotfix/[description-slug]` from the current main branch.

### 2. Identify and Fix Issue
Analyzes the issue, locates the root cause, and implements the minimal fix required.

### 3. Run Verification
Executes three verification gates:
- **Type Check**: `npx tsc --noEmit` must pass
- **Test Suite**: All tests must pass
- **Pattern Scanner**: `bash scripts/massu-pattern-scanner.sh` must pass

### 4. Commit with Conventional Format
Creates a commit using conventional commit format:
```
fix([scope]): [description]

[details if needed]
```

### 5. Push and Create PR
Pushes the branch to remote and creates a pull request with:
- Title matching commit message
- Description detailing the fix
- Links to related issues if applicable

## Abort Conditions

The hotfix workflow will abort if:

- **Scope exceeds 3 files**: More than 3 files need modification
- **Unrelated changes detected**: Working directory has uncommitted changes unrelated to the fix
- **Tests fail after fix**: The fix introduces new test failures

## When to Use

- **Quick bug fixes**: Production bugs that need immediate attention and touch 1-3 files
- **Typo corrections**: Documentation, comments, or code typos
- **Small targeted changes**: Minor improvements that don't require architectural planning
