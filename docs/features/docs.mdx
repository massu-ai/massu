# Documentation Tools

Massu AI includes tools for keeping your documentation in sync with your codebase. When code changes, these tools identify which documentation pages need updating and measure overall documentation coverage.

## Why This Matters

Documentation drift is one of the most common problems in software projects. Code changes daily, but docs lag behind. Massu AI maps your code to documentation pages, so when a file changes, you know exactly which docs need attention.

## Tools

### `massu_docs_audit`

**What it does:** Audit which help site pages need updating based on changed files. Uses a `docs-map.json` file that maps code paths to documentation pages.

**Usage:**

```
massu_docs_audit --changed_files ["src/server/routers/orders.ts"]
```

**Example output:**

```
## Documentation Audit

### STALE Pages (2)
- /help/orders/creating-orders
  Changed files: src/server/routers/orders.ts
  Sections affected: API endpoints, validation rules
  Action: Update procedure descriptions and parameter list

- /help/orders/order-lifecycle
  Changed files: src/server/routers/orders.ts
  Sections affected: Status transitions
  Action: Verify status flow diagram matches new code

### OK Pages (12)
All other mapped pages are up to date.
```

**Parameters:**

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|-------------|
| `changed_files` | string[] | no | Files to check (default: all recent changes) |

### `massu_docs_coverage`

**What it does:** Measure documentation coverage -- which features and code paths have corresponding documentation and which have gaps.

**Usage:**

```
massu_docs_coverage
```

**Example output:**

```
## Documentation Coverage Report

Total mappings: 24
Pages existing: 20
Pages with content: 18
Coverage: 75%

### Gaps (4 unmapped features)
- orders.export: No documentation page
- auth.sso: No documentation page
- reports.pdf-export: Page exists but empty
- users.bulk-import: Page exists but empty
```

**Parameters:** None.

## Configuration

Documentation tools use a `docs-map.json` file in your project root that maps code paths to documentation pages:

```json
{
  "version": 1,
  "mappings": [
    {
      "id": "orders-creating",
      "helpPage": "/help/orders/creating-orders",
      "appRoutes": ["/orders/new"],
      "routers": ["orders.create", "orders.validateDraft"],
      "components": ["src/components/orders/CreateOrderForm.tsx"],
      "keywords": ["create order", "new order"]
    }
  ]
}
```

## Tips

- Run `massu_docs_audit` after every major code change to catch documentation drift early
- Include `massu_docs_coverage` in your CI pipeline to track coverage over time
- The docs map file should be maintained alongside your code -- update it when you add new features
