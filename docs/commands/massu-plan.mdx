# /massu-plan

The `/massu-plan` command audits an existing plan document against the zero-gap standard. It checks for missing deliverables, unclear verification requirements, incomplete blast radius analysis, and other plan quality issues.

## Usage

```
/massu-plan docs/plans/2026-02-13-user-profile.md
```

## What It Does

1. **Opens and reads** the plan document (from the file, not from memory)
2. **Checks every section** against the plan quality standard:
   - Are all deliverables specific and verifiable?
   - Does every deliverable have a verification type?
   - Is the blast radius analysis complete?
   - Are there any ambiguous or vague items?
   - Are file paths specified for every deliverable?
3. **Identifies gaps** and lists them as findings
4. **Suggests improvements** to close each gap
5. **Updates the plan document** with improvements (plan doc only, not source code)

## The Zero-Gap Standard

A plan meets the zero-gap standard when:

- Every deliverable has a specific file path
- Every deliverable has a verification type (VR-FILE, VR-GREP, VR-BUILD, VR-TEST, etc.)
- The blast radius section accounts for ALL files that will be touched
- Removals specify what to grep for in negative verification
- No ambiguous language ("maybe," "consider," "possibly")
- Every dependency is listed with version
- Risk mitigations are actionable, not vague

## Example Findings

```
## Plan Audit: 2026-02-13-user-profile.md

### Findings (3)

1. [GAP] D-003: No validation schema specified for updateProfile input
   Suggestion: Add D-005a for Zod schema validation

2. [GAP] Blast radius: Missing src/server/routers/_app.ts which must
   import the new profile router
   Suggestion: Add to blast radius section

3. [AMBIGUOUS] D-002: "with crop" is vague - which crop library?
   Suggestion: Specify react-image-crop or similar
```

## Important Notes

- This command only modifies the plan document, never source code
- Run `/massu-plan` iteratively until the plan has zero findings
- A plan with findings should not proceed to `/massu-loop`
