# Code Review Insights

Aggregated quality analytics, risk hotspot identification, and developer activity heatmaps for your team.

## Requirements

- **Plan**: Cloud Team or higher

## Overview

Code Review Insights provides a team-level view of code quality and development patterns. Instead of reviewing individual sessions, you get an aggregated picture of how your team's AI-assisted development is performing.

## Key Features

### Health Scores

Track overall codebase health with scores computed from:

- Quality score averages across sessions
- Test coverage trends
- Pattern compliance rates
- Security score changes

### Risk Hotspots

Identify files and modules that consistently appear in risk analyses:

| Risk Type | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| Coupling | Files with high coupling scores that change together frequently |
| Complexity | Modules with increasing complexity metrics |
| Security | Areas with recurring security findings |
| Churn | Files modified in many sessions within a short period |

### Developer Activity Heatmap

Visualize which team members are active in which parts of the codebase. The heatmap shows:

- Activity intensity by file path and developer
- Time-based patterns (daily, weekly)
- Domain coverage across the team

## Accessing Insights

Navigate to **Dashboard > Team > Insights** to view the insights dashboard. Data is aggregated from all synced sessions across your team.

## Filtering and Time Ranges

Use the date picker and filters to narrow down insights:

- **Last 7 days** -- Recent activity snapshot
- **Last 30 days** -- Monthly trends
- **Custom range** -- Specific date range for deeper analysis

## Using Insights for Code Review

Code Review Insights helps you prioritize code reviews by:

1. Focusing reviews on high-risk areas identified by hotspot analysis
2. Ensuring coverage across domains by checking the activity heatmap
3. Tracking quality trends to catch regressions early
4. Identifying areas where the team might need additional support or training
