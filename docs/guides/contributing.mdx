Thank you for your interest in contributing to Massu AI! This guide covers everything you need to know to make your first contribution.

## Ways to Contribute

### Report Issues

Found a bug or have a feature idea?

1. Check [existing issues](https://github.com/ethankowen-73/massu/issues) first
2. Open a new issue with a clear title and description
3. Include steps to reproduce for bugs
4. Label appropriately (bug, enhancement, documentation)

### Improve Documentation

Documentation improvements are always welcome:

- Fix typos or unclear explanations
- Add examples or use cases
- Translate documentation
- Improve code samples

### Submit Code

Ready to write code?

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a feature branch (`git checkout -b feature/your-feature`)
3. Make your changes
4. Run the test suite (`npm test`)
5. Submit a pull request

## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- npm 9+
- Git

### Getting Started

```bash
# Clone your fork
git clone https://github.com/your-username/massu.git
cd massu

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run tests
npm test

# Type check
cd packages/core && npx tsc --noEmit

# Build hooks
cd packages/core && npm run build:hooks
```

### Environment Variables

The main configuration lives in `massu.config.yaml` at the project root. This config file controls:

- `toolPrefix` — Prefix for all MCP tool names (default: `massu`)
- `project.name` — Your project's display name
- `project.root` — Project root directory (use `auto` to detect)
- `paths.source` — Source code directory (default: `src`)
- `domains` — Domain boundary definitions for architecture validation
- `rules` — Pattern-specific coding rules

For the website (Cloud Dashboard), copy `website/.env.example` to `website/.env.local` and configure:

- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL` — Your site URL (e.g., `http://localhost:3000`)
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` — Supabase project URL
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` — Supabase anonymous key
- `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` — Supabase service role key (server-only)
- `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` — Stripe secret key (server-only)
- `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` — Stripe webhook signing secret
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PRICE_*` — Stripe price IDs for subscription tiers

See `website/.env.example` for the complete list with descriptions.

### Coding Standards

- **TypeScript strict mode** — No `any` types
- **ESM imports** — Use `.ts` extensions in `packages/core`
- **Config-driven** — Use `getConfig()` from `config.ts`, never hardcode project-specific values
- **Test everything** — Add tests for new features
- **Pattern compliance** — Run `bash scripts/massu-pattern-scanner.sh` before committing

### Pull Request Guidelines

1. **One feature per PR** — Keep changes focused
2. **Include tests** — New features need test coverage
3. **Update docs** — If your change affects user-facing behavior
4. **Follow existing patterns** — Look at similar code for conventions
5. **Write clear commit messages** — Explain the "why", not just the "what"
