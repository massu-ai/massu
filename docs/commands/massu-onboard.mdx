# /massu-onboard

A read-only command that generates a comprehensive onboarding guide for new team members. It analyzes your codebase structure, `massu.config.yaml` conventions, team knowledge base, and recent session summaries to produce a guide that covers architecture, development workflow, coding rules, and common pitfalls.

## What It Does

The onboard command gathers information from five sources:

1. **Codebase structure** -- Analyzes file organization, key entry points, domain boundaries, and architecture patterns
2. **massu.config.yaml** -- Extracts coding rules, domain definitions, framework configuration, and tool prefix
3. **Team knowledge base** -- Searches the memory database for decisions, ADRs, and team conventions captured in past sessions
4. **Failed attempts registry** -- Surfaces known-bad approaches to help new members avoid repeating mistakes
5. **Workflow commands** -- Documents the project's development workflow with command-specific guidance

The generated guide is written to `docs/ONBOARDING.md` (or a path you specify). It does not modify source code.

## Usage

Generate an onboarding guide with defaults:

```
/massu-onboard
```

Specify an output path:

```
/massu-onboard --output docs/team/onboarding.md
```

Generate a guide focused on a specific domain:

```
/massu-onboard --domain orders
```

## Output

The command generates a structured Markdown guide:

```markdown
# Project Onboarding Guide

## Development Workflow

The console output summarizes what was included:

## Onboarding Guide Generated

Output: docs/ONBOARDING.md

### Sections Generated
- Architecture Overview: 3 key components described
- Development Workflow: 5-command pipeline + 7 auxiliary commands
- Coding Conventions: 8 rules from massu.config.yaml
- Domain Boundaries: 4 domains documented
- Known Pitfalls: 3 failed attempts surfaced from memory
- Key Files: 12 entry points identified

### Source Data
- Memory entries consulted: 47
- ADRs included: 3
- Session summaries referenced: 12
```

## Tips

- Run `/massu-onboard` after significant architectural changes to keep the guide current
- The guide is most useful after several sessions of active development -- the more memory Massu AI has accumulated, the richer the pitfalls and conventions sections
- Share the generated guide in your repository so new members can read it before their first session
- Use `--domain` to generate focused guides for team members working in a specific area
- The guide does not replace human onboarding -- it supplements it with codebase-specific detail
