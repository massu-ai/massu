# Compliance Monitoring

Massu provides continuous compliance monitoring for Enterprise organizations, automatically tracking policy violations, computing compliance scores, and suggesting remediation actions.

## Compliance Score

Your organization's compliance score (0-100) is computed from three factors:

- **Violation severity** — Unresolved violations reduce your score (critical: -15, high: -10, medium: -5, low: -2 per violation)
- **Policy coverage** — The percentage of tool types covered by active policies
- **Audit completeness** — The percentage of actions with complete audit trail records

## Violation Detection

When sessions are synced, Massu automatically evaluates tool usage against your active policies. Violations are logged with full context including the session, user, tool, and policy that was violated.

## Remediation Suggestions

For common violation types, Massu provides automated remediation suggestions to help your team resolve issues quickly.

## Dashboard

View your compliance status in the [Compliance Dashboard](/dashboard/compliance), including:
- Real-time compliance score
- Violation trends over time
- Policy coverage indicators
- Quick links to schedules and evidence packages
