## Priority Replies (Recommended Today)

### 1. HIGHEST: Simon Willison (@simonw) - 2 hours old
**Post:** "I've published the first two chapters of a new guide to Agentic Engineering Patterns - coding practices and patterns to help get the best results out of coding agents like Claude Code and OpenAI Codex"
**Stats:** 23.8K views, 590 likes, 30 replies, 72 reposts, 666 bookmarks
**Thread:** https://x.com/simonw/status/2025990408514523517
**Angle:** speed_through_governance
**Why reply:** Simon is publishing a guide on agentic engineering patterns. This is the exact conversation we want to be in. 30 replies is manageable for visibility. Massive engagement (590 likes, 666 bookmarks) means this thread will grow. Fresh (2h). Varies from our overused governance_gap angle.

**Suggested reply:**

The test-first pattern has been the single biggest unlock for me. Once I started requiring agents to write and watch failing tests before implementing, the output quality jumped dramatically. The counterintuitive part is that adding verification steps made the whole cycle faster, not slower, because I stopped wasting time debugging bad generations. Curious if the guide will cover patterns for maintaining consistency across parallel agent sessions.

### 2. STRONG ALTERNATIVE: Simon Willison (@simonw) - 1 hour old
**Post:** '"Red/green TDD" talks about how you can get much better results from most coding agents by encouraging them to use test-first development where they watch the tests fail before building an implementation that lets them pass'
**Stats:** 4.5K views, 37 likes, 5 replies, 1 repost
**Thread:** https://x.com/simonw/status/2025992745299652906
**Angle:** 5_layer_defense
**Why reply:** Only 5 replies means near-guaranteed visibility. TDD for agents is exactly our verification thesis. Lower reach than the main post but much higher reply visibility.

**Suggested reply:**

This matches my experience exactly. The test-first loop gives you a verification layer the agent can't skip past. I've extended this by having the agent also write regression tests for every bug it introduces, so one failure creates multiple independent checks going forward. It compounds fast.

**Recommendation:** Reply to ONE of these, not both (same person, same day). Option 1 has 5x the reach. Option 2 has near-guaranteed visibility with only 5 replies.

**Note:** We already replied to Simon 3 days ago (reply-005, "Claw" term of art). This is a completely different topic so re-engaging is appropriate, but don't reply to both threads today.

## Notes for Next Scan

- **Simon's Agentic Engineering Patterns guide** is the best opportunity since we started. It's a living document; he'll likely promote more chapters. Watch for follow-up posts about specific patterns.
- **Gergely** is very active but in "hot take" mode (Anthropic IP, Google bans, AI disruption skepticism). None align with governance. Wait for engineering quality topics.
- **McKay** has been silent for 5 days. When he returns, his first post will be a good engagement window.
- **Karpathy** silent for 3 days. Unusual. Watch for return.
- **Boris** in celebration mode (Claude Code birthday). Watch for technical follow-ups.
- **WARNING:** Simon posted about "AI-generated replies being the scourge of Twitter" and "reply guy tools." DO NOT engage these threads under any circumstances.
- **Cooling period ended.** Ready to resume with 1-2 strategic replies this week.
- **Angle diversity:** Last 6 replies used governance_gap 3x, prevention_vs_detection 1x, context_isolation 1x, 700k_lines 1x. Today's recommended angles (speed_through_governance, 5_layer_defense) would add variety.
