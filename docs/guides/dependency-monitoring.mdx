# Dependency Monitoring

Massu monitors your project dependencies for security vulnerabilities, maintainer abandonment, and license changes.

## How It Works

When dependencies are synced to Massu, the system periodically checks each package against:

- **OSV Database** — Open Source Vulnerability database for known CVEs
- **npm Registry** — Package metadata including publish dates, license, and download stats

## Alert Types

| Alert Type | Description | Severity |
|-----------|-------------|----------|
| CVE | Known vulnerability discovered | Critical/High |
| Stale | No updates published in 12+ months | Medium |
| License Change | Package license has changed | High |
| Deprecated | Package marked as deprecated | Medium |
| Major Update | Major version available | Low |

## Risk Scores

Each dependency receives a risk score (0-100) based on:
- Number and severity of vulnerabilities
- Time since last publish
- License changes
- Download trends

## Dashboard

View all monitored dependencies in the [Dependencies Dashboard](/dashboard/dependencies) with filtering by risk level, alert status, and staleness.
