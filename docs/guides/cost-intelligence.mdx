# Cost Intelligence Guide

The Cost Intelligence dashboard gives you full visibility into your AI development spending. Available on Cloud Pro plans and above.

## Overview

The dashboard provides:

- **Daily cost trends** — Line chart showing spend over time
- **Model breakdown** — See which AI models cost the most
- **Feature attribution** — Understand cost per feature
- **Budget alerts** — Get notified when approaching spending limits
- **Spend forecasting** — Project month-end totals from current rate

## Setup

Cost Intelligence works automatically once you have cloud sync enabled:

1. Ensure you have a Cloud Pro (or above) subscription
2. Generate an API key from Settings
3. Enable sync in your `massu.config.yaml`
4. The daily cost snapshot function aggregates your data

## Setting a Budget

Navigate to **Cost Intelligence > Budget** in the dashboard:

1. Set your monthly budget amount (USD)
2. Configure the alert threshold (default: 80%)
3. Optionally set an alert email address
4. Save your budget settings

You'll receive an email when your spending reaches the alert threshold.

## Understanding Forecasting

The forecast uses a simple linear projection:

- It calculates your average daily spend for the current month
- Multiplies by remaining days to project month-end total
- The projection updates daily as new cost data arrives

## Cost Comparison

Compare spending across time periods:

- **This Week vs Last Week** — Short-term trend analysis
- **This Month vs Last Month** — Monthly budget tracking

Navigate to **Cost Intelligence > Compare** to access this feature.
