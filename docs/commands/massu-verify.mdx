# /massu-verify

Runs all applicable VR-* verification checks against the current work and produces a report with actual command output as proof. It enforces a zero-gap audit loop where all checks must pass in a single run before verification is complete.

## Usage

```
/massu-verify
```

No arguments required. The command automatically determines which VR-* checks are applicable based on the work being verified.

## What It Does

### Verification Planning
Before running any checks, the command enumerates all applicable VR-* checks based on the domains touched (tools, config, hooks, build, tests) and creates a verification strategy.

### Core Checks (Always Run)

| Check | Command | What It Catches |
|-------|---------|-----------------|
| VR-BUILD | `npm run build` | Build failures, compilation errors |
| VR-TYPE | `npx tsc --noEmit` | Type errors, interface mismatches |
| VR-TEST | `npm test` | Regressions, broken logic |
| Pattern Scanner | `bash scripts/massu-pattern-scanner.sh` | Pattern violations |
| Security | Scan for staged secrets and credentials in code | Leaked credentials |

### Conditional Checks

| Check | Runs When | What It Verifies |
|-------|-----------|------------------|
| VR-FILE | Files created or modified | File existence with non-zero size |
| VR-GREP | Code patterns added | Pattern present with line number proof |
| VR-NEGATIVE | Code removed | Zero remaining references via grep |
| VR-CONFIG | Config changes made | Config-code alignment for every key |
| VR-TOOL-REG | New MCP tools added | Tool registered in tools.ts, not just created |
| VR-HOOK-BUILD | Hooks modified | Hook compilation with esbuild |
| VR-HANDLER | Tool handlers added | Handler exists and returns a result |
| VR-PLAN-COVERAGE | Implementing a plan | 100% of plan items verified |

### Dual Gate System

Verification uses two independent gates that both must pass:

1. **Code Quality Gate** -- All VR-* checks pass, patterns comply, no security issues
2. **Plan Coverage Gate** -- Every plan deliverable is verified (100% coverage required)

### Zero-Gap Audit Loop

If any check fails, all issues are fixed and the entire audit re-runs from the beginning. Partial re-checks are not valid. The command only reports VERIFIED when a single complete pass finds zero issues.

## Output

Produces a structured report showing:
- Each VR-* check with its command, expected result, actual result, and PASS/FAIL status
- Pass/fail counts per category
- Plan coverage percentage (if applicable)
- Overall dual verification status
- List of gaps found (if any) with required fixes

## When to Use

- Before claiming any work is complete
- After implementing a plan to verify all deliverables
- As the final gate before `/massu-commit`
- When you need verifiable proof that changes are correct and complete
