# /massu-push-light

A fast pre-push verification gate that runs five critical checks in approximately 90 seconds. Designed to catch the most common CI failures without the overhead of full builds or end-to-end tests.

## Usage

```
/massu-push-light
```

No arguments required. Runs all five checks sequentially and stops on the first failure.

## What It Does

The command executes five checks in order:

### 1. Pattern Scanner (~5s)
Runs `bash scripts/massu-pattern-scanner.sh` to catch code pattern violations, import issues, and config anti-patterns.

### 2. TypeScript Check (~30s)
Runs `npx tsc --noEmit` to catch type errors, missing imports, and interface mismatches.

### 3. Hook Compilation (~5s)
Runs `npm run build:hooks` to verify all hooks in `packages/core/src/hooks/` compile with esbuild.

### 4. Unit Tests (~30s)
Runs the full vitest test suite to catch regressions, broken logic, and handler errors.

### 5. Build (~20s)
Runs `npm run build` to verify the full project compiles without errors.

## Output

```
==============================================
MASSU PUSH LIGHT - Fast Pre-Push Verification
==============================================

[1/5] Pattern Scanner...    PASS
[2/5] TypeScript Check...   PASS
[3/5] Hook Compilation...   PASS
[4/5] Unit Tests...         PASS
[5/5] Build...              PASS

==============================================
ALL CHECKS PASSED - Safe to push
==============================================
```

## When to Use

- **Before every `git push`** to catch roughly 90% of CI failures locally
- **After significant changes** as a quick sanity check
- **Before creating a pull request** to ensure a clean state

## When to Use Full Verification Instead

Use `/massu-push` (full) when making config schema changes, modifying tool registration patterns, changing core infrastructure, or preparing a major release.

## What This Skips

| Skipped Check | Risk Level |
|---------------|------------|
| Full integration tests | Medium |
| Security scanner | Low (run for security changes) |
| Coverage report | Low |
