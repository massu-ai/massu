# /massu-retrospective

A read-only command that generates a structured retrospective from Massu AI's session data. It analyzes quality events, cost tracking, decisions made, failed attempts, and rule violations to produce a retrospective report with actionable improvement items for the next session or sprint.

## What It Does

The retrospective command analyzes data from the memory database across six dimensions:

1. **Quality metrics** -- Quality scores per session, trend direction, and the events that drove score changes
2. **Cost summary** -- Total AI session cost, breakdown by model and tool type, and cost per feature
3. **Key decisions** -- Architectural and implementation decisions captured during the period
4. **Failed attempts** -- Approaches that were tried and abandoned, with reasons
5. **Rule violations** -- Canonical rule violations (CR-1 through CR-12) that occurred and their frequency
6. **Actionable items** -- Specific, prioritized improvements derived from the above data

The report is printed to stdout. It does not modify any files or source code.

## Usage

Retrospective for the current session:

```
/massu-retrospective
```

Retrospective for the last 7 days:

```
/massu-retrospective --days 7
```

Sprint retrospective (last 14 days):

```
/massu-retrospective --sprint
```

Retrospective since a specific date:

```
/massu-retrospective --since 2026-02-01
```

## Output

```
## Session Retrospective
Period: 2026-02-10 to 2026-02-16 (7 days)

### Quality Summary
- Average quality score: 74/100 (up from 68 last week)
- Sessions: 12
- Best session: 2026-02-14 (score: 88)
- Worst session: 2026-02-11 (score: 52 — 3 build failures)

### Cost Summary
- Total AI cost: $24.30
- Per session average: $2.02
- Most expensive feature: orders-refactor ($8.40)
- Model breakdown: claude-opus-4-6 (87%), claude-sonnet-4-5 (13%)

### Key Decisions (5)
1. Chose Prisma over Drizzle for migration management
2. Moved tRPC routers to domain folders
3. Adopted zod-form-data for form validation
...

### Failed Attempts (2)
1. drizzle-kit push with RLS tables -- always fails, use migrate
2. Direct Supabase auth in middleware -- use createServerSupabaseClient

### Rule Violations (3)
- CR-7 (tests must pass before claiming complete): 2 occurrences
- CR-1 (never claim without proof): 1 occurrence

### Actionable Items
1. [HIGH] Add pre-commit hook for test run to prevent CR-7 violations
2. [MEDIUM] Set cost alert threshold -- orders work is exceeding budget
3. [LOW] Document the Prisma vs Drizzle decision in an ADR
```

## Tips

- Run `/massu-retrospective` at the end of a sprint to prepare for your team retrospective meeting
- The `--sprint` flag defaults to 14 days -- use `--days N` for custom periods
- Quality score trends are the most actionable metric: a declining trend indicates systemic issues
- Failed attempts from retrospectives are surfaced by the `session-start` hook in future sessions -- they accumulate into a "do not retry" knowledge base
- Share the output with your team by piping to a file: `/massu-retrospective --sprint > docs/retros/2026-02-sprint.md`
