# /massu-estimate

A read-only effort estimation command that analyzes a task description or plan file and produces a complexity-scored estimate. It uses codebase impact analysis (how many files and domains would be touched), historical data from past sessions, and configurable complexity weights to generate a calibrated estimate in hours or story points.

## What It Does

The estimate command runs four analysis steps:

1. **Task parsing** -- Reads the task description or plan file and extracts the deliverables, affected files, and scope
2. **Impact analysis** -- Uses the CodeGraph database to identify all files, domains, and tRPC procedures that would be affected (similar to `massu_impact`)
3. **Complexity scoring** -- Scores the task across four dimensions: scope (number of files), novelty (new patterns vs. existing), risk (security/migration/type changes), and test coverage needed
4. **Historical comparison** -- Searches the memory database for similar past tasks and compares actual vs. estimated completion time

The result is a structured estimate with confidence intervals. It does not modify any files.

## Usage

Estimate from a task description:

```
/massu-estimate "Add pagination to the orders list endpoint"
```

Estimate from a plan file:

```
/massu-estimate docs/plans/2026-02-16-orders-pagination.md
```

Output in story points instead of hours:

```
/massu-estimate "Add pagination" --story-points
```

## Output

```
## Effort Estimate

Task: Add pagination to the orders list endpoint

### Impact Analysis
- Files directly affected: 4
  - src/server/routers/orders.ts
  - src/components/orders/OrderList.tsx
  - src/hooks/useOrders.ts
  - src/types/orders.ts
- Domains touched: 1 (orders)
- tRPC procedures modified: 1 (orders.listOrders)
- Test files needed: 2

### Complexity Breakdown
| Dimension | Score | Reason |
|-----------|-------|--------|
| Scope | 2/5 | 4 files, 1 domain |
| Novelty | 1/5 | Pagination is an established pattern in this codebase |
| Risk | 1/5 | No migrations, no auth changes |
| Test coverage | 2/5 | 2 test files needed |
| **Total** | **6/20** | Low complexity |

### Estimate
- **Most likely**: 2-3 hours
- **Optimistic**: 1.5 hours
- **Pessimistic**: 4 hours
- **Confidence**: High (similar past tasks: 3 matches)

### Historical Comparison
- "Add pagination to users list" (2026-01-28): 2.5 hours actual
- "Add pagination to products list" (2026-02-03): 3 hours actual
- Average actual: 2.75 hours
```

## Tips

- Estimates improve over time as Massu AI accumulates more historical session data
- Use plan files rather than descriptions for more accurate impact analysis -- plan files have explicit file paths
- The `--story-points` flag maps to a Fibonacci scale by default (1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13)
- High-risk tasks (migrations, auth changes, security) automatically receive a pessimistic multiplier
- Share estimates with your team before starting work to surface scope disagreements early
- Run `/massu-estimate` on your plan after `/massu-plan` for a full picture: plan quality + effort estimate
