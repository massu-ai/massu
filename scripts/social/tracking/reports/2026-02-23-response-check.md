### reply-001: @bcherny - Claude Code Security
**Thread URL:** https://x.com/bcherny/status/2024862488475505136
**Status:** URL BROKEN - page returns "doesn't exist"
**Our reply:** "Very cool. The scanning side is a huge step. Curious whether the longer-term vision includes enforcement at generation time too, not just detection after the fact?"
**Assessment:** Cannot verify. Tweet may have been deleted or URL was approximate from initial logging.

### reply-002: @bcherny - Git Worktrees
**Thread URL:** https://x.com/bcherny/status/2025007393290272904 (fixed from placeholder)
**Thread stats:** 1.2M views, 429 replies
**Our reply:** Not visible in Relevant sort (buried in 429 replies)
**Responses:** None found
**Assessment:** Thread too large. Our reply is effectively invisible. Boris's worktree post went mega-viral (1.2M views). Not a viable engagement thread going forward.

### reply-003: @GergelyOrosz - AI Bot Takes Down Amazon
**Thread URL:** https://x.com/GergelyOrosz/status/2024956822201794806
**Thread stats:** 40.6K views (was 17K), 269 likes (was 178), 40 replies (was 22)
**Our reply URL:** https://x.com/ethankowen/status/2025055728671871232
**Our reply:** "This is the right framing. The AI didn't cause the outage. The missing verification layer did. I run automated checks on every file write my AI agents make. Build gates, pattern scanning, blast radius analysis before any value change touches production. The number of subtle..."
**Reply stats:** 144 views, 0 likes, 0 replies
**Visible in Relevant sort:** YES
**Responses:** None
**Assessment:** Best performing reply. Visible in Relevant sort despite 40 total replies. 144 views is decent for a reply with no engagement. Thread grew 2.4x since posting. The governance_gap angle landed well here.

### reply-004: @karpathy - 400K Lines Vibe Coded
**Thread URL:** https://x.com/karpathy/status/2024987174077432126
**Thread stats:** 2.5M views (was 412K), 944 replies
**Our reply:** Not visible in Relevant sort (buried in 944 replies)
**Responses:** None found
**Assessment:** Thread went mega-viral (2.5M views, 6x growth). 944 replies means our reply is completely buried. Karpathy threads are too large for Phase 1 engagement. Wait for smaller, fresher threads from him.

### reply-005: @simonw - "Claw" as Term of Art
**Thread URL:** https://x.com/simonw/status/2024999368982757509
**Thread stats:** 57.1K views (was 15.5K), 484 likes (was 154), 51 replies (was 19)
**Our reply URL:** https://x.com/ethankowen/status/2025056890682830993
**Our reply:** "The interesting question for this whole category is: what does the trust model look like? Running someone else's 400K lines of vibe coded agents with access to your keys is a governance problem, not just a security one. Especially when these agents are acting autonomously. The..."
**Reply stats:** 142 views, 0 likes, 0 replies
**Visible in Relevant sort:** YES
**Responses:** None
**Assessment:** Solid placement. Visible among 51 replies. Thread grew 3.7x since posting. The governance angle on the "Claw" category discussion was a natural fit. 142 views but no engagement yet.

### reply-006: @mckaywrigley - Anthropic Policy Clarity
**Thread URL:** https://x.com/mckaywrigley/status/2024225225404273109
**Thread stats:** 38.3K views (was 37K), 349 likes, 50 replies (was 45)
**Our reply URL:** https://x.com/ethankowen/status/2025057280962490430
**Our reply:** "Clear rules that are consistently enforced is exactly the right ask. Same principle applies to the code itself. When your AI agents can't tell what's allowed vs. not allowed, you get the same confusion downstream. Explicit rules, automated enforcement, zero ambiguity. Works for..."
**Reply stats:** 3 views, 0 likes, 0 replies
**Visible in Relevant sort:** YES
**Responses:** None
**Assessment:** Lowest performing reply (only 3 views). Thread was already 2 days old when we replied (posted Feb 18, we replied Feb 20). Late replies to older threads get minimal visibility even when shown in Relevant sort. The governance_gap angle was appropriate but timing hurt reach.

## Data Hygiene Fixes Applied

1. **reply-002 URL fixed:** Changed from placeholder `2024900000000000000` to actual worktree post `2025007393290272904`
2. **Reply URLs captured:** Added actual reply URLs for reply-003, reply-005, reply-006
3. **Reply content captured:** Captured truncated text for reply-003, reply-005, reply-006
4. **Thread stats updated:** All thread stats refreshed to current values
5. **Reply stats added:** View/like/reply counts added for reply-003, reply-005, reply-006

## Learnings for Future Engagement

1. **Thread size matters:** Replies to threads with 400+ replies get buried. Target threads with <50 replies for visibility.
2. **Timing matters:** reply-006 (3 views) was posted to a 2-day-old thread. reply-003 (144 views) was posted same-day. Reply within 6 hours of the original post.
3. **Relevant sort visibility:** 3 of 4 verifiable replies appeared in Relevant sort, which is a good sign for account credibility. X's algorithm is showing our replies.
4. **0% response rate after 3 days:** Normal for Phase 1 with a new account. The goal is name recognition, not immediate conversations.
5. **governance_gap overused:** 3 of 6 replies used the same angle. Vary angles more in future engagement.

## Milestones

- None yet. No target account responses, follows, or DMs.

---

## Next Steps

- Cooling period ends today (Feb 23). Ready to resume engagement Feb 23-24.
- Run a fresh `/massu-internal-social-scan` to find new opportunities.
- Prioritize smaller threads (<50 replies) and same-day posts.
- Vary angles: use verification, automate_the_hawk, speed_through_governance, or 5_layer_defense next.
- Check notifications (2 unread on @ethankowen).
