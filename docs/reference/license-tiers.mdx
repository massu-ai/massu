## Offline Grace Period

Massu AI validates your license against the cloud endpoint and caches the result locally. If the cloud is unreachable, the cached tier remains active for a **7-day grace period**.

**How it works:**

1. On session start, Massu AI checks the local license cache in `memory.db`
2. If the cache is less than 1 hour old, it is used without a network call
3. If the cache is 1 hour to 7 days old and the cloud is unreachable, the cached tier is used (grace period)
4. If the cache is older than 7 days with no successful validation, tools fall back to the free tier

This means you can work offline, on planes, or behind restrictive firewalls for up to a week without losing access to paid tools.

## Tier Propagation From Stripe

When you subscribe or change your plan through Stripe:

1. Stripe sends a webhook to the Massu AI cloud endpoint
2. The cloud updates your organization's plan (`free`, `cloud_pro`, `cloud_team`, `cloud_enterprise`)
3. On your next session start (or within 1 hour if a session is active), the new tier propagates to your local cache
4. All tools for your new tier become available immediately

Plan downgrades take effect at the end of the current billing period. During the transition, you retain access to your current tier.

## Checking Your License

```bash
npx massu doctor
# Shows: License: Pro (valid until 2027-03-15)

```

Returns:

```
## License Status

**Tier**: PRO
**Valid Until**: 2027-03-15
**Days Remaining**: 384

### Tier Capabilities
- **Free**: Core navigation, memory, regression detection
- **Pro**: Knowledge search, quality analytics, cost tracking, observability
- **Team**: Sentinel feature registry, team knowledge sharing
- **Enterprise**: Audit trail, security scoring, dependency analysis
```

### Programmatic Access

The `massu_license_status` tool is always available (free tier) so you can check your tier from any session without needing paid tools.
