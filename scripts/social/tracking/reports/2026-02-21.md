## Cooling Period Advisory

Yesterday was a heavy engagement day: **6 replies across 5 accounts** (well above the 2-3/week target). Today's recommendation is to **cool off**. All targets have either been engaged already or don't have fresh posts with governance angles.

## Priority Replies (Recommended Today)

### 1. MARGINAL: Gergely Orosz (@GergelyOrosz) - 4 hours old
**Post:** "I am getting fatigue from reading more and more AI-written articles on this platform. I get a sense that it's AI-written a paragraph or two in, and full certainty by paragraphs 3 or 4..."
**Stats:** 40K views, 642 likes, 122 replies, 33 reposts
**Thread:** https://x.com/GergelyOrosz/status/2025235459786326294
**Angle:** slopacolypse_antidote
**Why reply:** Perfect "slopacolypse" angle. He's describing the content quality crisis that governance solves.
**Why hesitate:** 122 replies (buried risk), already engaged him yesterday, above weekly reply cap.

**Suggested reply:**

The irony is the same models writing that slop are capable of much better output. The difference is verification and constraints. I run every piece of AI-generated content through structured checks before it ships. The quality gap isn't about the model, it's about what you demand from it before you hit publish.

**Recommendation:** SKIP today. Save this angle for a future Gergely post when we haven't just engaged him. The slopacolypse theme will come up again.

## Notes for Next Scan

- Cool off period active. 6 replies in one day (Feb 20) is well above the 2-3/week target. Resume replying ~Feb 23-24.
- Gergely's AI-content-fatigue thread is a recurring theme. Save the "slopacolypse antidote" angle for his next post on this topic.
- Boris's worktree announcement hit 859K views. Watch for follow-up posts about worktree gotchas or governance.
- McKay has been silent for 3 days. Watch for his return.
- Simon's Doc Ock guardrail metaphor is clever. If the "claws need guardrails" discussion continues, that's a natural entry point.
- Karpathy's posts all have 750+ replies. Hard to get noticed. Wait for a smaller, fresher thread.

## Assessment

No new reply opportunities. All targets either have no new posts or are continuing threads we've already evaluated. The cooling period recommendation stands: resume engagement Feb 23-24.

Gergely's AI-content fatigue thread continues to grow and his "slopacolypse" angle remains the strongest future opportunity. His follow-up post (9 replies, 14K views) would have been a better entry point than the main thread, but we're still in cooling period and already engaged him yesterday.
