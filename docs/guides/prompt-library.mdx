# Prompt Library

Build a collection of proven prompts that your team can search, share, and rate for effectiveness.

## Requirements

- **Plan**: Cloud Pro (personal library) or Cloud Team (team-wide library)

## Overview

The Prompt Library lets you save effective prompts, rate them, and share them with your team. Over time, you build a searchable collection of proven instructions that produce high-quality AI output.

## Saving Prompts

### From the Dashboard

Navigate to **Dashboard > Prompt Library** and click **Save Prompt** to manually add a prompt:

| Field | Description | Required |
|-------|-------------|----------|
| Title | Short descriptive name | Yes |
| Content | The full prompt text | Yes |
| Tags | Categorization tags | No |
| Notes | Usage notes or context | No |

### Prompt Fields

Each saved prompt includes:

- **Title** -- A short, descriptive name
- **Content** -- The full prompt text
- **Tags** -- Categorization for filtering and search
- **Effectiveness Score** -- Computed from ratings and usage outcomes
- **Author** -- Who saved the prompt
- **Created/Updated** -- Timestamps

## Searching Prompts

The prompt library supports full-text search across titles, content, and tags. Use the search bar in **Dashboard > Prompt Library** to find prompts by keyword.

### Filtering

Filter prompts by:

- Tags
- Author (team library)
- Effectiveness score range
- Date range

## Rating Prompts

Rate prompts on a 1-5 scale to help the team identify the most effective ones. Ratings contribute to the effectiveness score, which is displayed on each prompt card.

### Effectiveness Score

The effectiveness score is computed from:

- User ratings (1-5 stars)
- Usage frequency
- Outcomes when the prompt was used in sessions

## Personal vs Team Library

| Feature | Cloud Pro | Cloud Team |
|---------|-----------|------------|
| Save prompts | Yes | Yes |
| Search prompts | Personal only | Team-wide |
| Share prompts | No | Yes |
| Rate prompts | Personal only | Team-wide |
| View team prompts | No | Yes |

## Best Practices

1. **Be specific** -- Save prompts that are detailed enough to reproduce good results
2. **Tag consistently** -- Use consistent tags across the team for better discoverability
3. **Rate honestly** -- Accurate ratings help surface the best prompts
4. **Update regularly** -- Revise prompts as your project evolves
5. **Add notes** -- Include context about when and why a prompt works well
