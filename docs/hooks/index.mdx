# Lifecycle Hooks

Massu AI includes 11 lifecycle hooks that run automatically during Claude Code sessions. These hooks capture observations, inject context, enforce rules, and preserve state -- all without any manual effort from the developer.

## How Hooks Work

Hooks are compiled TypeScript files that Claude Code executes at specific lifecycle events. Each hook:

1. **Receives JSON on stdin** with session context (session ID, transcript path, tool details)
2. **Processes the input** (reads databases, analyzes tool calls, generates context)
3. **Outputs result on stdout** (plain text for context injection, JSON for structured responses)
4. **Exits within 5 seconds** to avoid blocking Claude Code

Hooks are compiled with esbuild into standalone JavaScript files bundled inside the `@massu/core` npm package (`dist/hooks/`). They are automatically configured in `.claude/settings.local.json` when you run `npx massu init`. They have no runtime dependencies beyond Node.js built-ins and the bundled Massu AI modules.

## The 11-Hook Lifecycle

| Hook | Event | Purpose | Timing |
|------|-------|---------|--------|
| [session-start](/docs/hooks/session-start) | Session begins | Inject memory context | Startup, resume, compact |
| [session-end](/docs/hooks/session-end) | Session ends | Generate summary, archive state | Session stop |
| [post-tool-use](/docs/hooks/post-tool-use) | After each tool call | Capture observations | After every tool |
| [user-prompt](/docs/hooks/user-prompt) | User submits prompt | Capture prompts, link tasks | Every prompt |
| [pre-compact](/docs/hooks/pre-compact) | Before compaction | Preserve session state | Before context window compaction |
| [pre-delete-check](/docs/hooks/pre-delete-check) | Before file deletion | Feature impact check | Before rm/delete operations |
| [post-edit-context](/docs/hooks/post-edit-context) | After file edit | Surface applicable rules | After Edit/Write on src/ files |
| [security-gate](/docs/hooks/security-gate) | Before tool execution | Validate security policies | Before dangerous operations |
| [cost-tracker](/docs/hooks/cost-tracker) | After each tool call | Track token usage and costs | After every tool |
| [quality-event](/docs/hooks/quality-event) | After each tool call | Detect quality signals | After every tool |
| [intent-suggester](/docs/hooks/intent-suggester) | User submits prompt | Suggest relevant commands | Every prompt |

## Session Lifecycle Flow

```
Session Start
  |
  v
[session-start hook] --> Injects memory context
  |
  v
User writes prompt
  |
  v
[user-prompt hook] --> Captures prompt, links to task
[intent-suggester hook] --> Suggests relevant commands
  |
  v
Claude Code processes (reads, edits, runs commands)
  |
  v
[post-tool-use hook] --> Captures observation per tool call
[post-edit-context hook] --> Surfaces rules on file edits
[pre-delete-check hook] --> Checks feature impact on deletions
[security-gate hook] --> Validates security policies
[cost-tracker hook] --> Records token usage
[quality-event hook] --> Detects quality signals
  |
  v
(if context window fills up)
[pre-compact hook] --> Snapshots state before compaction
[session-start hook] --> Re-injects context after compact
  |
  v
Session ends
  |
  v
[session-end hook] --> Generates summary, archives CURRENT.md
```

## Zero Effort for Users

You do not need to interact with hooks directly. They run silently in the background:

- **No commands to remember**: Hooks trigger automatically at the right lifecycle events
- **No performance impact**: Each hook completes in under 500ms
- **No configuration needed**: Hooks use your `massu.config.yaml` automatically
- **Best-effort execution**: If a hook fails, it exits silently without blocking Claude Code

## Hook Compilation

Hooks are written in TypeScript and compiled with esbuild:

```bash
cd packages/core && npm run build:hooks
```

This produces standalone JavaScript files in `packages/core/dist/hooks/` that are referenced by `.claude/settings.local.json` during installation. Run `npx massu install-hooks` to update the hooks configuration.
