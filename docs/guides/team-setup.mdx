# Team Setup

When multiple developers use AI assistants on the same codebase, Massu AI's team features help coordinate work, share knowledge, and prevent conflicts.

## Enabling Team Features

In your `massu.config.yaml`:

```yaml
team:
  enabled: true
  sync_backend: local
  expertise_weights:
    session: 20
    observation: 10
  privacy:
    share_file_paths: true
    share_code_snippets: false
    share_observations: true
```

## How Team Knowledge Works

### Expertise Tracking

When a developer works on a module (edits files, fixes bugs, makes decisions), Massu AI tracks their expertise:

- **Session count**: How many sessions touched the module
- **Observation count**: How many meaningful observations were made
- **Expertise score**: Logarithmic formula: `min(100, log2(sessions+1) * 20 + log2(observations+1) * 10)`

The logarithmic scale means early experience counts more -- going from 0 to 5 sessions is more impactful than going from 50 to 55.

### Conflict Detection

Massu AI detects when two developers edit the same file within a configurable time window:

```
> Use massu_team_conflicts --days 7
```

This helps prevent merge conflicts and duplicated effort.

## Privacy Controls

Team features respect privacy settings:

| Setting | Default | What It Controls |
|---------|---------|-----------------|
| `share_file_paths` | true | File paths in shared observations |
| `share_code_snippets` | false | Actual code content |
| `share_observations` | true | Observation summaries |

With default settings, team members can see which files were worked on and what was decided, but not the actual code changes.

## Sync Backends

### Local (Default)

```yaml
team:
  sync_backend: local
```

Each developer has their own local database. Team data is shared through git (the `.claude/session-state/` directory).

### Shared

```yaml
team:
  sync_backend: shared
```

Team data is synced through a shared database location (e.g., a network drive or shared directory).

## Getting Started

1. Enable team features in your config
2. Have each team member run a few sessions
3. Use `massu_team_expertise` to see the expertise map
4. Use `massu_team_conflicts` daily to catch overlapping work
5. Use `massu_team_search` to find who knows about specific modules

## Tips

- Start with `share_code_snippets: false` for privacy
- Expertise scores are most useful after 2-3 weeks of data collection
- Run `massu_team_conflicts` at standup meetings to coordinate work
- High expertise in a module means that developer is the go-to person for questions about it
