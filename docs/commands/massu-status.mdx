# /massu-status

A comprehensive read-only health dashboard that runs 14 diagnostic checks across your codebase, infrastructure, and dependencies to provide an instant project health snapshot.

## Usage

```
/massu-status
```

## Health Checks

The command performs 14 distinct health checks:

### 1. TypeScript Compilation
Verifies all TypeScript files compile without errors using `npx tsc --noEmit`.

### 2. Test Suite
Runs the full vitest test suite and reports pass/fail status with coverage metrics.

### 3. Pattern Scanner
Executes `bash scripts/massu-pattern-scanner.sh` to verify 8 codebase patterns including ESM imports, config access, and tool registration.

### 4. Hook Build
Compiles all hooks in `packages/core/src/hooks/` using esbuild to ensure they build successfully.

### 5. Config Validity
Parses `massu.config.yaml` to verify valid YAML syntax and required schema fields.

### 6. Git State
Checks for uncommitted changes, unpushed commits, and branch status.

### 7. Dependency Freshness
Scans for outdated npm packages and security vulnerabilities.

### 8. Code-Graph DB
Verifies the Code-Graph database exists, is accessible, and has expected schema tables.

### 9. Website Health
For projects with a website, checks Next.js build status and Supabase connectivity.

### 10. Test Coverage Gaps
Identifies modules without test coverage by comparing source files to test files.

### 11. Bundle Size
Reports current bundle size and flags significant increases from baseline.

### 12. Migration Health
Validates Supabase migration files are sequential and have no conflicts.

### 13. API Endpoint Inventory
Lists all tRPC procedures and REST API endpoints with auth requirements.

### 14. Edge Function Inventory
Catalogs all Supabase Edge Functions and their deployment status.

## Health Classification

The dashboard classifies overall project health into three categories:

- **Healthy**: All 14 checks pass with no warnings
- **Degraded**: Some checks pass with warnings but no failures
- **Unhealthy**: One or more checks fail

## When to Use

- **Morning check**: Start each day by running `/massu-status` to verify project health before beginning work
- **Before starting work**: Use as a pre-flight check to catch issues early
- **After major changes**: Verify that refactoring, dependency updates, or architectural changes didn't break anything
