# /massu-feature-parity

The `/massu-feature-parity` command checks feature parity across your application portals. If a feature exists in one portal (e.g., internal admin), it checks whether equivalent functionality exists in other portals where it should be available.

## Usage

```
/massu-feature-parity
/massu-feature-parity --domain "orders"
```

## What It Checks

For each feature in the Sentinel registry:

1. **Which portals** the feature is registered in
2. **Which portals** should have the feature (based on domain configuration)
3. **Implementation status** in each portal (active, missing, degraded)

## Example Output

```
## Feature Parity Report

### Missing from Factory Portal (2)
- orders.create: Available in internal but not factory
  Expected components: CreateOrderForm, ProductSelector
  Status: NOT IMPLEMENTED

- orders.export: Available in internal but not factory
  Expected components: ExportButton
  Status: NOT IMPLEMENTED

### Missing from Customer Portal (1)
- orders.tracking: Available in internal and factory but not customer
  Expected components: OrderTracker, StatusTimeline
  Status: NOT IMPLEMENTED

### Full Parity (22/25 features)
22 features are available in all expected portals.

### Summary
Parity score: 88%
Missing implementations: 3
```

## When to Use

- After completing a feature in one portal, check if it needs to be replicated
- During sprint planning, to identify parity gaps
- Before releases, to ensure consistent functionality across portals

## Tips

- Feature parity depends on the Sentinel registry being up to date -- run `massu_sync` first
- Not all features need to be in all portals -- the check is based on registered expectations
- Use `massu_sentinel_register` to set portal expectations for features
