# /massu-debug

Systematic debugging protocol with hypothesis testing, root cause tracing, and learning capture for complex bugs.

## Usage

```
/massu-debug
```

## Protocol Steps

### 1. Symptom Capture
- Record exact error message and stack trace
- Document reproduction steps
- Capture environment context (test vs production, browser, etc.)
- Screenshot or log output if visual/console issue

### 2. Locate Error
- Identify the failing module/function from stack trace
- Read the source file where error occurs
- Note line number and surrounding context

### 3. Trace Call Chain
- Follow the execution path backwards
- Identify caller functions
- Map data flow from entry point to error
- Note any transformations or validations

### 4. Hypothesis Formation
- Generate 2-4 plausible root cause hypotheses
- Rank by likelihood based on evidence
- Document assumptions for each hypothesis

### 5. Hypothesis Testing
- Design minimal tests to prove/disprove each hypothesis
- Execute tests in order of likelihood
- Record results for each test
- Eliminate disproven hypotheses

### 6. Root Cause Identification
- Confirm the validated hypothesis
- Document the exact cause (bad input, logic error, race condition, etc.)
- Identify why existing safeguards didn't catch it

### 7. Fix Implementation
- Implement minimal fix for root cause
- Add defensive checks if safeguards were missing
- Follow CR-9: search codebase for same pattern and fix all instances

### 8. Verification
- Verify fix with original reproduction steps
- Run related tests (`/massu-test --affected`)
- Confirm no regressions introduced

### 9. Learning Record
- Document the bug, root cause, and fix in session state
- Add regression test if none existed
- Update validation rules if pattern should be caught earlier

## When to Use

- **For non-obvious bugs**: When the error message or stack trace doesn't immediately reveal the cause
- **When hotfix scope guard fails**: If `/massu-hotfix` identifies >3 files affected, use systematic debugging
- **For intermittent issues**: Race conditions, timing bugs, or environment-specific failures
- **Vs /massu-hotfix**: Use `/massu-hotfix` for obvious, small-scope fixes; use `/massu-debug` for complex investigations
